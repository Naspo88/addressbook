# About
This application is a simple web page to let user to track some contacts in the address
book.
The UI is fairly simple, it shows a header where is written the title of the page and who
developed the application. Above of it there is the application itself.
In the left-hand side of the page there is located the form to add or edit the elements in
the address book. In the right-hand side, there is the address book. Clicking on the
headers of the table allows users to order all the elements.
In the last row of the table there are the operations you can do to an element: the first
icon is the edit action, the second is instead the delete action.
Clicking on the edit button - the form in the left will be populated with all the element’s
data to let the user edit them. In the bottom, there is a button to revert the changes.
Clicking on the delete button will show up a popup asking the user to confirm the
deletion of the relative element.
All data is saved in the ‘localStorage’ so that it is persisted in the browser.

# Getting started

Execute 'npm install' to install all dependencies, then execute 'gulp build' to process the files and you can start to use the application.

# Used Tech

•	Angular.js - JS framework

•	Bootstrap - CSS framework

•	jQuery - to use some bootstrap functionality

•	SASS – as CSS processor

•	Gulp – to manage the initialization task

•	Country-list – to have all countries data

# What missing

I spent about 4 hours to build this simple application, focusing on making solid, clean
and readable code that works without bugs. With more time, it would be great to
improve the UX/UI of the application, to give the user a more enjoyable graphic.
