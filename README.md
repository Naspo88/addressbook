## About
This application is a simple web page to let user to track some contacts in the address book.

The User Interface is really simple, it shows a little header where is write the title of the page and who develop the application. Above of it there is the application itself.

In the left part of the page there is the form to add or edit the elements to the address book. In the right, there is the address book itself. Clicking to the headers of the table you can order all the present elements.

The last row of the table there are the operation you can do to this element: the first icon is the edit action, the second the delete action.

Clicking to the edit button the form in the left is populated with all element data to let the user to edit them. At the bottom appear a button to abort the changes.

Clicking to the delete button the user can see a popup asking him if is sure to delete this element. If click to remove the element is directly deleted from the address book.
All data are saved in the ‘localStorage’ to let the user not lose the data when is updating the page.

## What missing

I spent 4 hours to build this simple application, focusing on make a solid, clean and easy-to-read code that work without bugs.
